    There's a specific was you have to start off for all Coding. After creating a project, a class must be created
    It has to be public so other classes can call on it.
    Static is a method to call on the class without needing something to run it agaist.

    /* Java Variables and Data Types
        Variables are used to temporarily store data in computer's memory. In Java, the type of a variable should be
        specified at the time of declaration. There are Primitives and Reference types.
        The eight Primatives are byte,short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.
        Reference types don't store actual objects in memory. They store the address of an object in memory.
        Reference types are more complex
